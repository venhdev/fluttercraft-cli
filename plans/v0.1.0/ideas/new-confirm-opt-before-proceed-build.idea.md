# new-confirm-opt-before-proceed-build.idea.md

Currently, last phase when run 'build' cmd, it will ask user to confirm the "full command" which gonna run. User just type Y/n to confirm or cancel. 

We can improve this by adding a new option to edit the command before proceed by type 'e' or 'edit'.

then will show both original cmd and edited cmd, then ask again and again until user confirm or cancel.
